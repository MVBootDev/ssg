# Assignment

## Completed

1) Add the following files to a static directory in the root of your project:
static/images/tolkien.png
static/index.css

## Incomplete

1) Write a recursive function that copies all the contents from a source directory to a destination directory (in our case, static to public)

- It should first delete all the contents of the destination directory (public) to ensure that the copy is clean.
- It should copy all files and subdirectories, nested files, etc.
- I recommend logging the path of each file you copy, so you can see what's happening as you run and debug your code.
Here are some of the standard library docs that might be helpful:

os.path.exists
os.listdir
os.path.join
os.path.isfile
os.mkdir
shutil.copy
shutil.rmtree

2) Hook the function up to your main function and test it out. I didn't use a unit test for this one because it interacts with the file system: I just tested it manually.

3) Add the public/ directory to your .gitignore file. This is where the generated site will live. As a general rule, it's bad to commit generated stuff, especially if it can be regenerated easily.
Ensure that running main.sh generates the public directory and all the copied content correctly.****
