# TextNode to HTMLNode
We need a way to convert a TextNode to an HTMLNode, specifically a LeafNode.

Assignment
Write a function:
```python
def text_node_to_html_node(text_node):
```

It should handle each type of the TextType enum. If it gets a TextNode that is none of those types, it should raise an exception. Otherwise, it should return a new LeafNode object.

TextType.TEXT: This should return a LeafNode with no tag, just a raw text value.
TextType.BOLD: This should return a LeafNode with a "b" tag and the text
TextType.ITALIC: "i" tag, text
TextType.CODE: "code" tag, text
TextType.LINK: "a" tag, anchor text, and "href" prop
TextType.IMAGE: "img" tag, empty string value, "src" and "alt" props ("src" is the image URL, "alt" is the alt text)
Add some tests. Here's one to get you started:

```python
def test_text(self):
    node = TextNode("This is a text node", TextType.TEXT)
    html_node = text_node_to_html_node(node)
    self.assertEqual(html_node.tag, None)
    self.assertEqual(html_node.value, "This is a text node")
    ```
