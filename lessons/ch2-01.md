TextNode
We're going to need a way to represent all the different types of inline text. We're going to be parsing Markdown text, and outputting it to HTML, so we need an intermediate representation of the text in our code.

When I say "inline" I just mean text that is part of a larger block of text. For us, this includes:

text (plain)
**Bold text**
_Italic text_
`Code text`
Links, in this format: [anchor text](url)
Images, in this format: ![alt text](url)
Everything else we're considering block level, like headings, paragraphs, and bullet lists, and we'll handle those later.

Assignment
Create a simple main.sh shell script in the root of the project. This will be a convenient way to run our code. It should contain:
python3 src/main.py

Create a src directory with a main.py python file. This is where we'll write our Python code. Make it print "hello world", and make sure that running the main.sh script runs the main.py file and prints "hello world":

```python
./main.sh
# hello world
```

Create a .gitignore file in the root of the project. It should contain:
__pycache__/

This will prevent autogenerated __pycache__ directories from being committed to Git. Finally, create a src/textnode.py file, and read on to see what it should contain.

In textnode.py create an enum called TextType. It should cover all the types of text nodes mentioned above.
Here's an example of how you can create an enum:

```python
from enum import Enum
****
class Bender(Enum):
    AIR_BENDER = "air"
    WATER_BENDER = "water"
    EARTH_BENDER = "earth"
    FIRE_BENDER = "fire"
```

In `textnode.py` create a class called `TextNode`. It should have 3 properties that can be set in the constructor:
`self.text` - The text content of the node
`self.text_type` - The type of text this node contains, which is a member of the TextType enum.
`self.url` - The URL of the link or image, if the text is a link. Default to None if nothing is passed in.
Create an __eq__ method that returns True if all of the properties of two TextNode objects are equal. Our future unit tests will rely on this method to compare objects.
Create a __repr__ method that returns a string representation of the TextNode object. It should look like this:
`TextNode(TEXT, TEXT_TYPE, URL)`

Where TEXT, TEXT_TYPE, and URL are the values of the text, text_type, and url properties, respectively.

You can get the string representation of the text_type enum by using the .value field.

Create a main() function in main.py and call it. The function should create a new TextNode object with some dummy values. Print the object, and make sure it looks like you'd expect. For example, my code printed:
`TextNode(This is some anchor text, link, https://www.boot.dev)`

Run and submit the CLI tests from the root of the project.

You can delete the files in the public directory, they aren't needed anymore.

Tips
You may need to make main.sh executable by running:
`chmod +x main.sh`

In Python, if you want to use code from one file in another file, you need to import it. For example, to use a SuperCar class from a cars.py file in a main.py file in the same directory, you would write:
`from cars import SuperCar`
